title:  "Setting up a 2 Meter (144 MHz) APRS Packet station with a Raspberry Pi"

I've got a few unused HTs that do not have CTCSS/PL tone boards. They are mostly useless with local repeaters, which all require a CTCSS tone in order to activate it. However, it would be great for APRS!

I also have a collection of Raspberry Pis that are collecting dust. I think they have more than enough CPU and RAM to decode APRS. Additionally, I have a LCD screen with 4 buttons and a rocker switch. It would be cool utilize it if possible.

Radio: Yaesu FT-11R

Computer: Raspberry Pi

Things I need to complete the project:

* An audio cable to interface between the radio and the Raspberry Pi
* Potentially a USB audio interface
* Software TNC for Linux, preferably Python 3 compatable to make use of the LCD screen
