I get tired of having to remember to make sure I have everything setup correctly, so here is what I remember:

1. Install the driver for the KX3 cable (FT232R USB UART), reboot

2. Set KX3 menu "RS232" to 38400b, default is 4800

3. Download and install WSJT-X, make settings look like this:

4. Download and install FLDigi, make settings look like this:
