I want to have one, maybe two different headsets that I can use with any of my radios.

I've looked at the Heil headsets, and I don't really care for their look. None of them look comfortable. They look big and heavy!

I do have a Plantronics Savi W720 wireless headset that I do like and feels very comfortable. I would like to build a set of cables that interface with all of my radios and allow me to use the same headset (or headsets).

I like the over-the-ear style, but not bulky. For portable operations, I would like a single, in-ear piece with a small boom mic. I used to have this type of cable with an old Kyocera cell phone.
