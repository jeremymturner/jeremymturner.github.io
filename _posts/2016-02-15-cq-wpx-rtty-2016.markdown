I'm getting back into ham radio after a long absence. I think the last time I operated was back at the 
W5OCC station at Oklahoma Christian. It's been so long, I don't even remember what equipment we had. 
I do recall we had a beam of some sort with a rotor. Anyway, I'll write up another post on what I've 
been up to getting back into radio.
<!-- 
I'm currently in an apartment on the bottom floor, and that doesn't lend itself to a very good antenna. 
I tried the MFJ hamsticks, and couldn't hear much. I did hear a couple local CW operators, and I emailed 
them letting them know I heard them. I've heard a few local folks on SSB/Phone as well. I heard a few 
hams from the region, one barely from Santa Fe, NM, another in Denver. 

I ended up striking up a conversation with a local ham, John. After a few exchanges, he said he had some 
antenna gear he could donate to me if I wanted. So we setup a time on a sunny Saturday afternoon.

This weekend was the 2016 CQ WPX RTTY contest. I've never done anything with RTTY, and have never made an 
HF digital mode contact. But I have a decent radio with a USB connection, and a MacBook, so how hard could 
it be to figure out?

I strung up a 40' random wire along with a Chameleon base on the ground next to my apartment, with the 
wire elevated to 10' and angling back to a plastic drain pipe, and down. I didn't know how well this would 
really work, but I tuned up on 20 meters, and answered an SSB CQ call from a station in Chicago, and he 
came back to me! Sweet! Only 35 watts of power as well. That night, I made additional contacts into Texas, 
Kansas, and Missouri on 40 meters.

Back to RTTY. I'd never done anything with RTTY, so I had to read my radio manual along with some web 
page guides for the connected software and how to get it setup properly. I had been receiving PSK31 fine 
but had never been able to transmit. With some luck, I was able to make 3 RTTY contacts on 40 meters 
before calling it a night!

Sunday afternoon rolls around, and I decided to give 20 meters a try. For 3 hours until the end of the 
contest, I made 57 additional contacts to 17 states, 4 Canadian provinces, and a total of 4 countries.

Not too shabby!!

A new one for me was Brazil. Because I'm getting back into the hobby, pretty much every contact is a 
new one!

I heard P49X from Aruba calling CQ, but he was not able to hear me back. That would have been cool.

I'm looking forward to getting on more of the HF digital modes. I had a lot of fun!
